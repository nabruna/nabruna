### About me
📍 Brazil

✍🏻 Besides writing professionally, I love filling my journal with thoughts, ideas, quotes, and fanfics.

📖 My favorite fiction genres are thrillers, horror, greek mythology and YA romance. Yes, I'm corny like that.

📼 TV shows, movies, documentaries: you name it, I'll watch. Even the bad ones.

🎮 Pro gamers beware, here I come! Just kidding, I just play single-player, sometimes isometric, RPGs and Paradox games.

🐈‍⬛ Naná is my chill furry companion who loves to snuggle up next to me in bed and show her whiskers and tail to my coworkers during company calls.

🛼 When I'm feeling adventurous, I fall on my ass wearing my quads. Other than that, I'm a couch potato.
