- 👋 Hi, I’m @nanellide and I'm looking forward to becoming a front-end developer.
- 👀 I’m interested in literature and games. Come talk to me about greek mythology and theatre anytime!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, Javascript, and Angular!
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything for the moment, busy schedule. 
- 📫 Reach me via my lurking twitter @nanellide.
