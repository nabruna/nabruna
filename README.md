- 👋 Hi, I’m @nanellide and I think this is a cute file, so I'm working with this!
- 👀 I’m interested in literature and games. Come talk to me about greek mythology and theatre anytime!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and javascript. I love one and hate the other, guess which.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything for the moment, busy schedule. 
- 📫 Reach me via my lurking twitter @nanellide.
