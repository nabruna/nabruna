# About me

- 👩🏻‍💻 Heya, I'm **Bruna Andrade**, your friendly neighbourhood technical writer!
- 🇧🇷 Being Brazilian means I will always find a way to do anything. I'm not being inspirational, it's called *gambiarra*. Look it up!
- ✍🏻 Besides writing professionally, I love filling my journal with thoughts, ideas, quotes, and fanfics.
- 📖 My favorite fiction genres are thrillers, horror, greek mythology and YA romance. Yes, I'm corny like that.
- 📼 TV shows, movies, documentaries: you name it, I'll watch. Even the bad ones.
- 🎮 Pro gamers beware, here I come! Just kidding, I just play single-player, sometimes isometric, RPGs and Paradox games.
- 🐈‍⬛ Naná is my chill furry companion who loves to snuggle up next to me in bed and show her whiskers and tail to my coworkers during company calls.
- 🛼 When I'm feeling adventurous, I fall on my ass wearing my quads. Other than that, I'm a couch potato.
